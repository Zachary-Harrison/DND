# Session 1 - 10/29/2021

------

We fight a T-Rex in the woods named Patricia and a Lizardfolk riding Patricia.  We kill them both.

Riddle: "I eat, I live. I breath, I live. I drink, I die." -> fire

We went to a dungeon, solved some puzzles, got a cool box, a magic amulet, and a +1 scimitar that requires attunement for *some reason* 

+1,425 XP (1 T-rex + 4 will-o-wisp = 3900 + 4*450 / 4 = 1425)
