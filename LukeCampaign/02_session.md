# Session 2 - 11/5/2021

------

We took a long rest at the dinosaur's nest outside the dungeon. 

**What the hell is up with these flying lemur monkeys?**

I am trying to go to a temple in the jungle called Jrusar (Drew-sar) so that I can meet with some godly people that can help me expel my demons. We think it is to the northwest. 

There's a beaten up Drow (Iodas) in the woods late at night. I invite him over to the campfire to help. He says that "they killed everybody. The ones with wings like that. They came from the sky and they took everybody." I help him out. There's a big bite mark on his shoulder and waist - lycanthropy? He wasn't able to see them. They came by surprise from the trees. They grabbed his friends and carried them into the sky. They were about goliath size with massive wings. A lot of his scratches appear to be infected. 

We get jumped by some werebats, and Iodas turns into a werebat.

Eren wants to figure out where the werebats came from. 

We all get 933 xp.
