**DM:**

- Alex Rea - Reese (Hexblade Warlock)
- Eric Aikens - Ernie (Barbarian)
- Jackson Gardener  - Tomyras (Toe-my-riss) (FEMALE Paladin)

We meet in a Tavern! Woohoo! Some dude named Erin recruited us for an escort mission to <u>Emberwood Village</u>.

We are going to meet in the morning at the East Gate of Altburg.

Ernie searches a bandit camp and finds a coin that looks like that it was cast in lead and then gilded in gold. On one side, it has a hat with a feather sticking out of it and on the other it has text that says "Queen of Thieves".

### What is Delirium?

    An arrow tipped with it looks like it has cursed someone. There is a faint octarine glow. If cake were magic, this would be cake. The dude who is infected with it has blank white eyes. He hasn't spoken in several days, but more concerning is: He has flesh tendrils instead of hands and he has a mouth on his stomach that appears to be mumbling. Delirium is more dense than gold. 

    We wake up in the night and have to fight *Delirium Dreg*. It is HORRIFIC!!

The Academy really wants Delirium because they say they can use it to make magic items and spell components. As such, it is worth more than gold. 

### We arrive at <u>Emberwood Village</u>

Emma Crow gives us a tour around Emberwood and we find:

- There are two taverns called the <u>Gilded Lily</u>, the <u>Bark and Buzzard</u>, and the <u>Skull and Sword</u>
- <u>Redlion Hotel</u>: Hotel/inn
- <u>Crowe and Son(s)</u>: blacksmith - good steel

River gives me a job: Go to the <u>Rat's Nest</u> and find a large source of Delirium. Delirium can be handled with steel or precious metals OR encase it in glass. She says she'll pay me 500-2000 gold, depending on how big the piece is.
