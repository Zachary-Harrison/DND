# Session 8

Payment for Oscar Yoren. He's much more outfitted than expected since he's been living in the city for 10 years. The bounty is still 4,000 gold. River offers an orb of delirium (Pearl of Power) that you can hold. It's called neutralized delirium. 

The dude who stole my and Earnest's money in the Skull and Sword tavern makes us go and talk to him. 

We're on the outskirts of Drakkenheim and see the 12 Ratlings and Scritches! There's another ratling named Britches, whose pants fall down a lot. There's this sexy rat named Tails who wants to have sex with me. 

Earnest's two eyes become one big eye that deals 2d6 + int mod radiant damage.
