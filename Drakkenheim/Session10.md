# Session 10

Oscar, as a show of faith, casts a spell (similar to Glyph of Warding) on me using a dagger. He cuts himself and my hand and asks if I accept the "bond". I feel his dark energy move into me and sit in my chest. In my heart. **What the fuck just happened to me?** If I or any of my party members talk to a known member of the Amethyst Academy, you will explode (fireball, centered on myself). Or if I go against them in any way. Or if I don't do their job in a timely manner. The spell does not last forever.

The Eldritch Lilies are found in Queens' Park Gardens.

Hodge didn't take part in the sacrament, where you put a shard of delirium in your chest (like Nathaniel Flint). 

We go to the Mill off in Cairn Hills. There's some Eldritch lightning around the meteor? And now rainfall. We spot some Hooded Lanterns, who appear to be headed in a different direction.

These webs are fucked up, man. I gain the following Drakkenheim madness: **I must go into the ruins and kill. Rip and tear, until it is done.**
