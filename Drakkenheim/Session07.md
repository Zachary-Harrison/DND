# Session 7

###### We end this session running into the deeper city. Our rogue was revived and now has a -4 to attacks, ability checks, and saving throws.

During the deeper city, we will need to roll a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 14-16) every hour or gain a level of contamination. 

Tomyras and Reese enter the deeper city alone. Tomyras died, and Reese comes back very hurt and contaminated.

I should look for a flower with white petals with veins of purple so that I can make a fake potion that makes someone *feel* like they've lost a level of contamination.

Oooooo Jackson is gonna be playing Hodge now? That's dope!

#### Day 2 of Rest

Talk to Amethyst Academy. Eldrick Runeweaver gives me the material components to learn Sending as a ritual. 

#### Day 3 of Rest

Some soldiers come to Emberwood Village. One group with Manticore Symbol (brown horse - House Jackson) and Giant Serpent (white horse - House Jones). A halfling from House Jones is a little bitch and I want to kill him.

I tell Aris Jackson everything I know about Delirium and Drakkenheim. I put emphasis on finding a flower with white petals and purple veins.
