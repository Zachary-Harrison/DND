# Session 5

### We are in the streets of the Spokes

I'm apparently being stalked by a rogue? His name is Kaladan (wood elf). He is an Arcane Trickster. 

We get jumped by some shadows after taking a short rest in an alleyway

### We arrive at Emberwood Village

We see Aldor the Immense and learn that the Amethyst Academy has learned how to drink Delirium safely.

1. Reese and I go to see River
   1. Convince the Ironhelm dwarves to start selling Delirium to the Amethyst Academy instead of the Queen of Thieves.
   2. Oscar Yoren (in Reed Manor) was expelled for necromancy. Excellent researcher. Get the research to the Amethyst Academy and bring him to them (preferably alive). 
2. Tomyras goes to the Blacksmith (Tobias Crowe)
   1. Iron from the meteor is very tough and stuff. He'd need about 60 lbs of the iron to make Plate Armor, 55 lbs for splint.
3. Kaladan goes to the Skull and Sword (Thieves guild)
   1. Caspian Princess (Firstname Jackson) came through <u>Emberwood Village</u>
   2. Go Talk to Mel (back room). Short, greasy man. He's clearly cheating and has lots of money.

The Toy Maker went to Drakkenheim and joined the Followers of the Falling Fire
