# Session 6

##### We are in <u>Emberwood Village</u>

Questions about Laws

1. Are there any laws?
   
   Yes, but they are not really enforced. The Hooded Lanterns are essentially cops without backup, which makes it hard to enforce laws.

We see a wagon covered with fine silk, pulled by two jet black horses. It bears the insignia of a mage from the amethyst academy. **The horses are fucking sentient???** After I start messaging profanities to the horses, I fall to the ground and hear a message says something along the lines of "I would highly recommend you stop messing with my property." Some dude from the Amethyst Academy (Eldrick Runeweaver, River's higher-up and acting leader of Amethyst Academy) comes out and scolds me and shit. Fuck him and the whole Academy.

Eldrick tells Earnest to go kill Oscar Yoren. Apparently, there is a fairy in the Amethyst Academy named Professor Noodles (one of the best researchers my father had, but went to Gulag and managed to escape), who joined a while ago. He lives in Reed Manor. She'll give us 2,000-4,000 gold (more if we bring him alive).

Tomyras wants us to go to <u>Champion's Gate</u> in the Spokes. She's trying to find an old Toy Maker. She hands me the note that says, "To whomever it may concern, I have found a greater light. If you need me, I am at Champion's Gate."

##### We plan to go to Champion's Gate and Reed Manor.

We see some gregs off in the distance. We find a burnt, wealthy house that hasn't been scavenged yet.

Kaladan died to a mimic

We find Lecretian Mathias, who raised Kaladan from the dead using a large Delirium Shard.

Tomyras storms off and I follow him to the camp of the Falling Fire

###### We end this session running into the deeper city.
