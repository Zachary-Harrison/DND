# Session 6

##### We are in <u>Emberwood Village</u>

Questions about Laws

1. Are there any laws?
   
   Yes, but they are not really enforced. The Hooded Lanterns are essentially cops without backup, which makes it hard to enforce laws.

We see a wagon covered with fine silk, pulled by two jet black horses. It bears the insignia of a mage from the amethyst academy. **The horses are fucking sentient???** After I start messaging profanities to the horses, I fall to the ground and hear a message says something along the lines of "I would highly recommend you stop messing with my property." Some dude from the Amethyst Academy (Eldrick Runeweaver, River's higher-up and acting leader of Amethyst Academy) comes out and scolds me and shit. Fuck him and the whole Academy.

Eldrick tells Earnest to go kill Oscar Yoren. Apparently, there is a fairy in the Amethyst Academy named Professor Noodles, who joined a while ago.
