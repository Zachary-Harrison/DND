# Session 9

We are at Shepherd's Gates. 

We get to Reed Manor (Oscar Yoren's House). All the people seem to be really tired. Gemma is a Gnome, Tyra is a human, and Marco is something. Marco casts Purge Contamination on Oliver and Earnest, which gets rid of all mutations.

We finally meet Oscar Yoren. He is a balding obese man with a dirty beard and purple eyes. He tells us where to find the delirium flower I'm trying to get my hands on.

Bolter the dwarf threw something at me and he takes my weed. What a guy.
