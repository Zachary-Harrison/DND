# Session 4 (One-on-one) - 2/19/22

I knock out Lukas and lock him in the bathroom after stealing the chunk of Delirium and getting it on my Tenser's Floating Disk. When I arrive at the gate, I am told that there is a 20% tax on all goods leaving Drakkenheim. Luckily, Ansom intervenes and lets me pass... for a price. 

- I sell the delirium to Ansom for 2500 gold and 500 gold worth of Delirium Dust (10 uses | action: +1 contamination, Adv on spell attack rolls and saves against spells.)
- He promised to teach me how to use Delirium properly and learn spells, but not before I do a quest for him: go to Champion's Road and rob a bunch of people who are supposedly coming to Drakkenheim with their life's savings.

I can't take a direct route to Champion's Road, so I have to walk along the outskirts of the city. While doing that, I encounter a Troll. It almost kills me, but I inexplicably survive.
