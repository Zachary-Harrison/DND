# Session 11

We finish off the phase spiders. 

The doors at College Gate are burst open. It appears as though the phase spiders had used this place as a feeding ground. There is silver, gold, and platinum strewn around. Armor is in incredible shape. I do not see any emblems for House Jackson. Their bodies were liquified and sucked out, leaving the rest of their body in perfect shape. Like a mummy. 

There's this dwarven wizard with 6 rings. He's probably been here for like 7 years. This wizard was particularly interested in using gemstones with delirium and how it could create new types of magic. 

1. Spell scroll of Drawmiji's Instant Summons (except it's a homebrew version - it is only 3rd lvl, but the item but be on the same plane of existence)
2. Spell scroll of Continual Flame
3. Spell scroll of Delirium Orb

#### Magic Item (Wristband of Knowledge)

Passive ability: while wearing this item, you know an extra cantrip of your spellcasting class. Additionally, upon while attuned to this weapon, you can know/prepare an additional spells equal to your proficiency bonus. 

We get to Queen's Park Garden and Earnest gets charmed by something that may or may not be an Eldritch Lily. It's this giant flower with yellow petals 3 feet in diameter. He gets charmed by it and walks into some purple/black sludge because "it knows where Bert is".
