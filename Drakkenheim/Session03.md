# Session 3 - 2/13/22

Bert has some really nice handwriting. 

### We go arrive at the Rat's Nest Tavern

- Smells like wet rat
- 30 ft wide hole in the middle of the tavern. Would've normally led to a cellar, but that's where the meteor landed.
- *The Haze* seems to be emanating from the hole in the wall. 
- It seems like something dragged the meteor further into the hole after it fell through the roof.

"The Rat God will provide" - Tomyras

We get the delirium from the Rat's Nest and rescue Petra

### We arrive at Shepherd's Gate

- Meet The Queen of Thieves (Andon)
  - Offers me 5000 gp for the Delirium rock we got from the Rat's Nest
  - OR 3000 gold to also teach me how to liquidate delirium, use it, and snort it.
