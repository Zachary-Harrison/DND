# Session 2

We are at the center square of <u>Emberwood Village</u> at about 4:00 PM.

We see *Aldor the Immense* on our way our way out of Emberwood Village, and he is apparently a merchant of sorts. He gets chocolate from a guy off the East Coast. He has not heard of coffee. He's also willing to buy trinkets and delirium off of us.

We take a road called <u>Champion's Way</u> on our way to Drakkenheim.

## We finally arrive at <u>Drakkenheim</u>

We see:

1. the <u>Dujagrada</u>, which is "the soul of the city". It shines with this octarine purple color.
2. the cathedral of <u>Saint Betruvio</u>.
3. the dark black academy tower
4. <u>Castle Drakken</u>
5. This purple-ish mist called *The Haze*. It reduces visibility to ~500 ft.

We enter the <u>the Sprawl</u>:

- the newest addition to Drakkenheim before the meteor hit. It was the poor part of the city. 
- It is covered in dead bodies (not monstrous) that do not look like they will come back. Many appear to be dead adventurers, but others seem to be people who were trying to flee. 
- We think we could stay in here for about 24 hours without taking contamination. However, we still cannot take a long rest. 

We hear sounds of a ruckus and people pleading "help me" and "save me". We ignore them.

The closer we are to the wall, the worse *The Haze* is.

Gnolls appeared around the same time that the meteor landed. Perhaps they are from Delirium?

**<u>Don't go to Slaughter Stone Square</u>**: written by three different people. It looks like he was the only one that survived. His name was not crossed out. His name was Andre, and it was made a couple years ago.
