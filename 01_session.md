   The group arrived near the _Dwarven Valley_ in the middle of a blizzard. In this valley, we 
eventually made our way to a cave. Inside of the cave was a yeti and on top of the cave was a 
Crag cat, both of which we defeated. To find some warmth, we went north to a town called 
[Lonely Wood], there was a gnome with a wand riding a giant bird that told us to clear the road.

   When we got to [Lonely Wood], we tried to all get snow boots so that snow didn't count as difficult
terrain when walking through it. In exchange for getting Silbjorn snow boots and 50 gold, we took 
a quest to track down this white moose that was killing lumberjack dwarves. After we killed the 
moose, there was this snowy owl that Ashe shot, which promptly turned into a druid. (Druid have
to be at least level 8 to get access to flying animals). The druid knocked down almost all of us 
instantly with Wind Wall and then flew away.
